# Layout and compilation of the library

The library is divided into packages which group together related
files. Each package defines a distribution and compilation unit.

Packages can be compiled using the traditional `make` utility or
the more recent `OPAM` one. The released and current dev version are
also available as opam packages.

## Compilation and installation of released and current dev version with OPAM
If you just installed opam you may have to do the following. You may also want
to read opam user manual first https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Usage.html
```
opam init
eval `opam config env`
```
Once your opam envionement is configure you can install any math-comp package via
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam pin add -n coq -k version 8.7.0
opam install coq -j3
opam install coq-mathcomp-ssreflect.1.6.4 -j3
```
Replace `ssreflect` here by the package you want, dependencies will be
installed automatically. You can replace `1.6.4` by `dev` to get the last
development version. We recommand to pin a particular version of Coq
(here `8.7.0`).

## Compilation and installation with make

The instructions assume you are in the `mathcomp` directory and that
you have a supported version of Coq.
The list of Coq versions that are known to work can be obtained with:
```
ls ssreflect/plugin/
```
Alternatively, if you are familiar with the `OPAM` slang:
```
grep depends: ssreflect/opam
```

If `coqc` is in your `PATH`, then you are good to go.  Alternatively you
can export the `COQBIN` variable to tell make where the `coqc` binary is:
```
export COQBIN=/home/gares/COQ/coq/bin/
```

To compile the entire library just type `make`. If you have parallel
hardware then `make -j 3` is probably a faster option. 

The files can be edited using CoqIDE or Proof General, or any
other editor that understands the `_CoqProject` file, with no
further configuration from the `mathcomp` directory.
```
coqide ssreflect/div.v
```
Note that you may need to enable `_CoqProject` processing in your
editor (e.g. the default for CoqIDE is to ignore it).

To install the compiled library, just execute `make install`.

## Compilation and installation of a custom version using OPAM

The instructions assume you are in the `mathcomp` directory
and that you have `OPAM` installed and configured with the
standard Coq repositories.

For each package, pin the `opam` file:
```
opam pin -n add ssreflect
```
This can be achieved in one go as follows:
```
for P in */opam; do opam pin -n add ${P%%/opam}; done
```

Then you can use `opam install` to compile and install any package.
For example:
```
opam install coq.8.7.0 coq-mathcomp-ssreflect
```
