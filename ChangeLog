??/??/???? - version 1.7.1
	* Added companion matrix of a polynomial `companionmx p` and the
	  theorems: companionmxK, map_mx_companion and companion_map_poly

	* Added all_iff, "the following are all equivalent"
	  with notation [<-> P0; P1; ..; Pn] and theorems
	  `all_iffLR` and coercion `all_iffP` (see header for doc)
	  proved by circular implication P0 -> P1 -> ... -> Pn -> P0

24/04/2018 - compatibility with Coq 8.8 and several small fixes - version 1.7

	* Added compatibility with Coq 8.8 and lost compatibility with
	  Coq <= 8.5. This release is compatible with Coq 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8.

	* Integration to Coq: ssrbool.v ssrfun.v and plugin.
	  ssrtest also moved to Coq test suite.

	* Cleaning up the github repository: the math-comp repository is
	  now dedicated to the released material (as in the present
	  release). For instance, directories real-closed and odd-order now
	  have their own repository.

	* Library refactoring: algC ssrnum: Library ssrnum.v now
	  provides an interface numClosedFieldType, which abstracts the
	  theory of algebraic numbers. In particular, Re, Im, 'i,
	  conjC, n.-root and sqrtC, previously defined in library algC.v,
	  are now part of this generic interface. In case of ambiguity,
	  a cast to type algC, of complex algebraic numbers, can be used to
	  disambiguate via  typing constraints. Some theory was thus made
	  more generic, and the corresponding lemmas, previously defined in
	  library algC.v (e.g. conjCK) now feature an extra, non maximal
	  implicit, parameter of type numClosedFieldType. This could break
	  some proofs.

	* Lemma dvdn_fact was moved from library prime.v to library div.v

	* Structures, changes in interfaces:
	  numClosedFieldType

	* New Theorems:
	  iter_in, finv_in, inv_f_in, finv_inj_in, fconnect_sym_in,
	  iter_order_in, iter_finv_in, cycle_orbit_in, fpath_finv_in,
	  fpath_finv_f_in, fpath_f_finv_in
	  big_allpairs
	  uniqP, uniqPn
	  dec_factor_theorem,
	  mul_bin_down, mul_bin_left
          abstract_context (now merged in Coq)

	* Renamed/generalized:
	  mul_Sm_binm -> mul_bin_diag
	  divn1 -> divz1 (in intdiv)
	  rootC -> nthroot
	  algRe -> Re
	  algIm -> Im
	  algCi -> imaginaryC
  	  reshape_index_leq -> reshape_leq
	  Every theorem from ssrnum that used to be in algC

	* Generalized or improved:
	  ltngtP, contra_eq, contra_neq, odd_opp, nth_iota

24/11/2015 - major reorganization of the archive - version 1.6

	* Files split into sub-directories: ssreflect, algebra, fingroup,
	  solvable, field and character. In this way the user can decide
	  to compile only the subset of the Mathematical Components library
	  that is relevant to her. Note that this introduces a possible
	  incompatibility for users of the previous version. A replacement
	  scheme is suggested in the installation notes.

	* The archive is now open and based on git. Public mirror at:
	         https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp

	* Sources of the reference manual of the Ssreflect tactic language are
	  also open and available at:
		https://github.com/math-comp/ssr-manual
	  Pull requests improving the documentation are welcome.

	* Renaming or replacements:
	  conjC_closed -> cfConjC_closed
	  class_transr -> class_eqP
	  cfclass_transl -> cfclass_transr
	  nontrivial_ideal -> proper_ideal
	  zchar_orthonormalP -> vchar_orthonormalP

	* Definitions that changed:
	  seq_sub

	* Statements that changed:
	  orbit_in_transl, orbit_sym, orbit_trans, orbit_transl, orbit_transr,
	  cfAut_char, cfConjC_char, invg_lcosets, lcoset_transl,
	  lcoset_transr, rcoset_transl, rcoset_transr, mem2_last,
	  bind_unless, unless_contra, all_and2, all_and3, all_and4, all_and5,
	  ltr0_neq0, ltr_prod, Zisometry_of_iso

	* New definitions:
	  adhoc_seq_sub_choiceMixin, adhoc_seq_sub_[choice|fin]Type

	* New theorems:
	  orbit_in_eqP, cards_draws, cfAut_lin_char, cfConjC_lin_char,
	  extend_cfConjC_subset, isometry_of_free, cfAutK, cfAutVK,
	  lcoset_eqP, rcoset_eqP, class_eqP, gFsub_trans, gFnorms,
	  gFchar_trans, gFnormal_trans, gFnorm_trans, mem2_seq1,
	  dvdn_fact, prime_above, subKr, subrI, subIr, subr0_eq,
	  divrI, divIr, divKr, divfI, divIf, divKf, impliesP, impliesPn,
	  unlessL, unlessR, unless_sym, unlessP (coercion), classicW,
	  ltr_prod_nat

	* New notation: "\unless C, P"

12/03/2014 - split the archive in SSReflect and MathComp - version 1.5
	* With this release "ssreflect" has been split into two packages.
	  The Ssreflect one contains the proof language (plugin for Coq) and a
	  small set of core theory libraries about boolean, natural numbers,
	  sequences, decidable equality  and finite types. The Mathematical
	  Components one contains advanced theory files covering a wider
	  spectrum of mathematics.

	* With respect to version 1.4 the proof language got a few new
	  features related to forward reasoning and some bug fixes. The
	  Mathematical Components library features 16 new theory files and in
	  particular: some field and Galois theory, advanced character theory
	  and a construction of algebraic numbers.

05/09/2012 - ssreflect - version 1.4
	* With this release the plugin code received many bug fixes and the
	  existing libraries relevant updates.  This release also includes
	  some new libraries on the following topics: rational numbers,
	  divisibility of integers, F-algebras, finite dimensional field
	  extensions and Euclidean division for polynomials over a ring.

	* The release includes a major code refactoring of the plugin for Coq
	  8.4.  In particular a documented ML API to access the pattern matching
	  facilities of Ssreflect from third party plugins has been introduced.

14/03/2011 - ssreflect - version 1.3
	* The tactic language has been extended with several new features,
	  inspired by the five years of intensive use in our project. However we
	  have kept the core of the language unchanged; the new library compiles
	  with Ssreflect 1.2.  Users of a Coq 8.2 toplevel statically linked
	  with Ssreflect 1.2 need to comment the Declare ML Module "ssreflect"
	  line in ssreflect.v to properly compile the 1.3 library.  We will
	  continue supporting new releases of Coq in due course.

	* The new library adds general linear algebra (matrix rank, subspaces)
	  and all of the advanced finite group that was developed in the course
	  of completing the Local Analysis part of the Odd Order Theorem,
	  starting from the Sylow and Hall theorems and including full structure
	  theorems for abelian, extremal and extraspecial groups, and general
	  (modular) linear representation theory.

14/08/2009 - ssreflect - version 1.2
	* No change log

18/03/2008 - ssreflect - version 1.1
	* First public release
