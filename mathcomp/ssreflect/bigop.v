(* This file provides a generic definition for iterating an operator over a   *)
(* set of indices (bigop); this big operator is parameterized by the return   *)
(* type (R), the type of indices (I), the operator (op), the default value on *)
(* empty lists (idx), the range of indices (r), the filter applied on this    *)
(* range (P) and the expression we are iterating (F). The definition is not   *)
(* to be used directly, but via the wide range of notations provided and      *)
(* which support a natural use of big operators.                              *)
(*   To improve performance of the Coq typechecker on large expressions, the  *)
(* bigop constant is OPAQUE. It can however be unlocked to reveal the         *)
(* transparent constant reducebig, to let Coq expand summation on an explicit *)
(* sequence with an explicit test.                                            *)
(*   The lemmas can be classified according to the operator being iterated:   *)
(*  1. Results independent of the operator: extensionality with respect to    *)
(*     the range of indices, to the filtering predicate or to the expression  *)
(*     being iterated; reindexing, widening or narrowing of the range of      *)
(*     indices; we provide lemmas for the special cases where indices are     *)
(*     natural numbers or bounded natural numbers ("ordinals"). We supply     *)
(*     several "functional" induction principles that can be used with the    *)
(*     ssreflect 1.3 "elim" tactic to do induction over the index range for   *)
(*     up to 3 bigops simultaneously.                                         *)
(*  2. Results depending on the properties of the operator:                   *)
(*     We distinguish: monoid laws (op is associative, idx is an identity     *)
(*     element), abelian monoid laws (op is also commutative), and laws with  *)
(*     a distributive operation (semirings). Examples of such results are     *)
