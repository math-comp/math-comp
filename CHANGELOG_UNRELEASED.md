# Changelog (unreleased)

To avoid having old PRs put changes into the wrong section of the CHANGELOG,
new entries now go to the present file as discussed
[here](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/wiki/Agenda-of-the-April-23rd-2019-meeting-9h30-to-12h30#avoiding-issues-with-changelog).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added contrapostion lemmas involving propositions: `contra_not`, `contraPnot`, `contraTnot`, `contraNnot`, `contraPT`, `contra_notT`, `contra_notN`, `contraPN`, `contraFnot`, `contraPF` and `contra_notF` in ssrbool.v and `contraPeq`, `contra_not_eq`, `contraPneq`, and `contra_neq_not` in eqtype.v
- in `ssralg.v`, new lemma `sumr_const_nat` and `iter_addr_0`
- in `ssrnum.v`, new lemma `ler_sum_nat`

- in `seq.v`, new lemmas: `take_uniq`, `drop_uniq`
- in `fintype.v`, new lemmas: `card_geqP`, `card_gt1P`, `card_gt2P`,
  `card_le1_eqP` (generalizes `fintype_le1P`),
- in `finset.v`, neq lemmas: `set_enum`, `cards_eqP`, `cards2P`
- in `fingraph.v`, new lemmas: `fcard_gt0P`, `fcard_gt1P`
- in `finset.v`, new lemmas: `properC`, `properCr`, `properCl`
- in `ssrnat.v`, new lemmas: `subn_minl`, `subn_maxl`
- in `ssrnat.v`, new lemma: `oddS`


- Added a factory `distrLatticePOrderMixin` in order.v to build a
  `distrLatticeType` from a `porderType`.

- Added lemmas `hasNfind`, `memNindex` and `findP` in `seq`
- in `matrix.v`, new lemmas `row_usubmx`, `row_dsubmx`, `col_lsubmx`,
  and `col_rsubmx`.

### Changed

- in ssrbool.v, use `Reserved Notation` for `[rel _ _ : _ | _]` to avoid warnings with coq-8.12
- in `ssrAC.v`, fix `non-reversible-notation` warnings

- In the definition of structures in order.v, displays are removed from
  parameters of mixins and fields of classes internally and now only appear in
  parameters of structures. Consequently, each mixin is now parameterized by a
  class rather than a structure, and the corresponding factory parameterized by
  a structure is provided to replace the use of the mixin. These factories have
  the same names as in the mixins before this change except that `bLatticeMixin`
  and `tbLatticeMixin` have been renamed to `bottomMixin` and `topMixin`
  respectively.

- The `dual_*` notations such as `dual_le` in order.v are now qualified with the
  `Order` module.
