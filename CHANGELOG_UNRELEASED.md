# Changelog (unreleased)

To avoid having old PRs put changes into the wrong section of the CHANGELOG,
new entries now go to the present file as discussed
[here](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/wiki/Agenda-of-the-April-23rd-2019-meeting-9h30-to-12h30#avoiding-issues-with-changelog).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

  `existsPn`, `exists_inPn`, `forallPn`, `forall_inPn`.

- Bigop theorems: `big_rmcond`, `bigD1_seq`,
  `big_enum_val_cond`, `big_enum_rank_cond`,
  `big_enum_val`, `big_enum_rank`, `big_set`.

- Arithmetic theorems in ssrnat and div:
  - some trivial results in ssrnat: `ltn_predl`, `ltn_predr`,
    `ltn_subr` and `predn_sub`,
  - theorems about `n <=/< p +/- m` and `m +/- n <=/< p`:
    `leq_psubRL`, `ltn_psubLR`, `leq_subRL`, `ltn_subLR`, `leq_subCl`,
    `leq_psubCr`, `leq_subCr`, `ltn_subCr`, `ltn_psubCl` and
    `ltn_subCl`,
  - some commutations between modulo and division: `modn_divl` and
    `divn_modl`,
  - theorems about the euclidean division of additions and subtraction,
     + without preconditions of divisibility: `edivnD`, `edivnB`,
       `divnD`, `divnB`, `modnD`, `modnB`,
     + with divisibility of one argument: `divnDMl`, `divnMBl`,
       `divnBMl`, `divnBl` and `divnBr`,
     + specialization of the former theorems for .+1 and .-1:
       `edivnS`, `divnS`, `modnS`, `edivn_pred`, `divn_pred` and
       `modn_pred`.

- Added map/parametricity theorems about `path`, `sort` and `sorted`:

- Added `mem2E` in `path.v`.

- Added `sort_rec1` and `sortE` to help inductive reasoning on `sort`.

- Added map/parametricity theorems about `path`, `sort`, and `sorted`:
  `homo_path`, `mono_path`, `homo_path_in`, `mono_path_in`,
  `homo_sorted`, `mono_sorted`, `map_merge`, `merge_map`, `map_sort`,
  `sort_map`, `sorted_map`, `homo_sorted_in`, `mono_sorted_in`.

- Added the theorem `perm_iota_sort` to express that the sorting of
  any sequence `s` is equal to a mapping of `iota 0 (size s)` to the
  nth elements of `s`, so that one can still reason on `nat`, even
  though the elements of `s` are not in an `eqType`.

- Added stability theorems about `merge` and `sort`: `sorted_merge`,
  `merge_stable_path`, `merge_stable_sorted`, `sorted_sort`, `sort_stable`,
  `filter_sort`, `mask_sort`, `sorted_mask_sort`, `subseq_sort`,
  `sorted_subseq_sort`, and `mem2_sort`.

- New algebraic interfaces : comAlgebra and comUnitAlgebra for
  commutative and commutative-unitary algebras.

- Initial property for polynomials in algebras:
  New canonical lrMoprphism `horner_alg` evaluating a polynomial in an element
  of an algebra. The theory include the lemmas `in_alg_comm`, `horner_algC`,
  `horner_algX`, `poly_alg_initial`.

- Added lemmas on commutation with difference, big sum and prod:
  `commrB`, `commr_sum`, `commr_prod`.

### Changed

- `eqVneq` lemma is changed from `{x = y} + {x != y}` to
  `eq_xor_neq x y (y == x) (x == y)`, on which a case analysis performs
  simultaneous replacement of expressions of the form `x == y` and `y == x`
  by `true` or `false`, while keeping the ability to use it in the way
  it was used before.

- Generalized the `allpairs_catr` lemma to the case where the types of `s`,
  `t1`, and `t2` are non-`eqType`s in `[seq E | i <- s, j <- t1 ++ t2]`.

- Generalized `muln_modr` and `muln_modl` removing hypothesis `0 < p`.

- Generalized `sort` to non-`eqType`s (as well as `merge`,
  `merge_sort_push`, `merge_sort_pop`), together with all the lemmas
  that did not really rely on an `eqType`: `size_merge`, `size_sort`,
  `merge_path`, `merge_sorted`, `sort_sorted`, `path_min_sorted`
  (which statement was modified to remove the dependency in `eqType`),
  and `order_path_min`.

- `compare_nat` type family and `ltngtP` comparison predicate are changed
  from `compare_nat m n (m <= n) (n <= m) (m < n) (n < m) (n == m) (m == n)`
  to `compare_nat m n (n == m) (m == n) (n <= m) (m <= n) (n < m) (m < n)`,
  to make it tries to match subterms with `m < n` first, `m <= n`, then
  `m == n`.
  + The compatibility layer for the version 1.9 is provided as the
    `ssrnat.mc_1_9` module. One may compile proofs compatible with the version
    1.9 in newer versions by using this module.

### Infrastructure

- `Makefile` now supports the `test-suite` and `only` targets. Currently,
  `make test-suite` will verify the implementation of mathematical structures
  and their inheritances of MathComp automatically, by using the `hierarchy.ml`
  utility. One can use the `only` target to build the sub-libraries of MathComp
  specified by the `TGTS` variable, e.g.,
  `make only TGTS="ssreflect/all_ssreflect.vo fingroup/all_fingroup.vo"`.
