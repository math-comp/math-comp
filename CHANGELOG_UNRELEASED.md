# Changelog (unreleased)

To avoid having old PRs put changes into the wrong section of the CHANGELOG,
new entries now go to the present file as discussed
[here](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/wiki/Agenda-of-the-April-23rd-2019-meeting-9h30-to-12h30#avoiding-issues-with-changelog).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added fixpoint and cofixpoint constructions to `finset`: `fixset`,
  `cofixset` and `fix_order`, with a few theorems about them

- Added functions `tuple_of_finfun`, `finfun_of_tuple`, and their
  "cancellation" lemmas.

- Added theorems `totient_prime` and `Euclid_dvd_prod` in `prime.v`

- Added theorems `ffact_prod`, `prime_modn_expSn` and `fermat_little`
  in `binomial.v`

- Added theorems `flatten_map1`, `allpairs_consr`, and `mask_filter` in `seq.v`.

- Fintype theorems: `fintype0`, `card_le1P`, `mem_card1`,
  `card1P`, `fintype_le1P`, `fintype1`, `fintype1P`.

- Bigop theorems: `big_rmcond`, `bigD1_seq`,
  `big_enum_val_cond`, `big_enum_rank_cond`,
  `big_enum_val`, `big_enum_rank`, `big_set`.

- Arithmetic theorems: `modn_divl` and `divn_modl`.

- Added map/parametricity theorems about `path`, `sort` and `sorted`:

- Added `mem2E` in `path.v`.

- Added `sort_rec1` and `sortE` to help inductive reasoning on `sort`.

- Added map/parametricity theorems about `path`, `sort`, and `sorted`:
  `homo_path`, `mono_path`, `homo_path_in`, `mono_path_in`,
  `homo_sorted`, `mono_sorted`, `map_merge`, `merge_map`, `map_sort`,
  `sort_map`, `sorted_map`, `homo_sorted_in`, `mono_sorted_in`.

- Added the theorem `perm_iota_sort` to express that the sorting of
  any sequence `s` is equal to a mapping of `iota 0 (size s)` to the
  nth elements of `s`, so that one can still reason on `nat`, even
  though the elements of `s` are not in an `eqType`.

- Added stability theorems about `merge` and `sort`: `sorted_merge`,
  `merge_stable_path`, `merge_stable_sorted`, `sorted_sort`, `sort_stable`,
  `filter_sort`, `mask_sort`, `sorted_mask_sort`, `subseq_sort`,
  `sorted_subseq_sort`, and `mem2_sort`.

### Changed

- `eqVneq` lemma is changed from `{x = y} + {x != y}` to
  `eq_xor_neq x y (y == x) (x == y)`, on which a case analysis performs
  simultaneous replacement of expressions of the form `x == y` and `y == x`
  by `true` or `false`, while keeping the ability to use it in the way
  it was used before.

- Generalized the `allpairs_catr` lemma to the case where the types of `s`,
  `t1`, and `t2` are non-`eqType`s in `[seq E | i <- s, j <- t1 ++ t2]`.

- Generalized `muln_modr` and `muln_modl` removing hypothesis `0 < p`.

- Generalized `sort` to non-`eqType`s (as well as `merge`,
  `merge_sort_push`, `merge_sort_pop`), together with all the lemmas
  that did not really rely on an `eqType`: `size_merge`, `size_sort`,
  `merge_path`, `merge_sorted`, `sort_sorted`, `path_min_sorted`
  (which statement was modified to remove the dependency in `eqType`),
  and `order_path_min`.

### Infrastructure

- `Makefile` now supports the `test-suite` and `only` targets. Currently,
  `make test-suite` will verify the implementation of mathematical structures
  and their inheritances of MathComp automatically, by using the `hierarchy.ml`
  utility. One can use the `only` target to build the sub-libraries of MathComp
  specified by the `TGTS` variable, e.g.,
  `make only TGTS="ssreflect/all_ssreflect.vo fingroup/all_fingroup.vo"`.
