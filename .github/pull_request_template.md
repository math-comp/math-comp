##### Things done/to do

<!-- please fill in the following checklist -->
- [ ] added corresponding entries in `CHANGELOG_UNRELEASED.md`

<!-- only append to minimize problems when merging/rebasing -->
<!-- consider the use of `changelog/changes.sh` from
     https://github.com/math-comp/tools to generate the changelog -->

- [ ] added corresponding documentation in the headers
- [ ] tried to abide by the [contribution guide](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

<!-- Cross-out the above items using ~crossed out item~ if they happen not to be relevant -->

##### Compatibility with MathComp 2.0

<!-- If this PR targets `master` and if it is merged, the merged commit will also be
     cherry-picked on the branch `hierarchy-builder`.

     In this case, it would be helpful if the author of the PR also prepares a PR
     for the branch `hierarchy-builder` or at least warns maintainers with an issue
     to delegate the work. -->

<!-- use the tag TODO: HB port to record divergences between `master` and `hierarchy-builder` -->

- [ ] I added the label `TODO: HB port` to make sure someone ports this PR to
      the `hierarchy-builder` branch **or** I already opened an issue or PR (please cross reference).
