##### Compatibility with MathComp 1.X

<!-- If this PR targets `master` and if it is merged, the merged commit may be
     cherry-picked on the branch `mathcomp-1` if possible.

     In this case, it would be helpful if the author of the PR also prepares a PR
     for the branch `mathcomp-1` or at least warns maintainers with an issue
     to delegate the work. -->

<!-- use the tag TODO: MC-1 port to record divergences between `master` and `mathcomp-1` -->

- [ ] I added the label `TODO: MC-1 port` to make sure someone ports this PR to
      the `mathcomp-1` branch **or** I already opened an issue or PR (please cross reference).
