<a name="lab4"></a><h1 class="section">Zmodule (additive abelian groups):</h1>

              zmodType == interface type for Zmodule structure.             
 ZmodMixin addA addC add0x addNx == builds the mixin for a Zmodule from the 
                          algebraic properties of its operations.           
          ZmodType V m == packs the mixin m to build a Zmodule of type      
                          zmodType. The carrier type V must have a          
                          choiceType canonical structure.                   
 [zmodType of V for S] == V-clone of the zmodType structure S: a copy of S  
                          where the sort carrier has been replaced by V,    
                          and which is therefore a zmodType structure on V. 
                          The sort carrier for S must be convertible to V.  
       [zmodType of V] == clone of a canonical zmodType structure on V.     
                          Similar to the above, except S is inferred, but   
                          possibly with a syntactically different carrier.  
                     0 == the zero (additive identity) of a Zmodule.        
                 x + y == the sum of x and y (in a Zmodule).                
<ul class="doclist">
<li> x == the opposite (additive inverse) of x.             

</li>
</ul>
                 x - y == the difference of x and y; this is only notation  
                          for x + (- y).                                    
                x *+ n == n times x, with n in nat (non-negative), i.e.,    
                          x + (x + .. (x + x)..) (n terms); x *+ 1 is thus  
                          convertible to x, and x *+ 2 to x + x.            
                x *- n == notation for - (x *+ n), the opposite of x *+ n.  
        \sum</i>&lt;range&gt; e == iterated sum for a Zmodule (cf bigop.v).          
                  e`<i>i == nth 0 e i, when e : seq M and M has a zmodType    
                          structure.                                        
             support f == 0.-support f, i.e., [pred x | f x != 0].          
         oppr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under opposite. 
         addr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite    
                           sums (0 and x + y in S, for x, y in S).          
         zmod_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under zmodType  
                          operations (0 and x - y in S, for x, y in S).     
                          This property coerces to oppr_pred and addr_pred. 
         OpprPred oppS == packs oppS : oppr_closed S into an opprPred S     
                          interface structure associating this property to  
                          the canonical pred_key S, i.e. the k for which S  
                          has a Canonical keyed_pred k structure (see file  
                          ssrbool.v).                                       
         AddrPred addS == packs addS : addr_closed S into an addrPred S     
                          interface structure associating this property to  
                          the canonical pred_key S (see above).             
         ZmodPred oppS == packs oppS : oppr_closed S into an zmodPred S     
                          interface structure associating the zmod_closed   
                          property to the canonical pred_key S (see above), 
                          which must already be an addrPred.                
 [zmodMixin of M by &lt;: ] == zmodType mixin for a subType whose base type is  
                          a zmodType and whose predicate's canonical        
                          pred_key is a zmodPred.                           
&gt; Coq can be made to behave as if all predicates had canonical zmodPred  
     keys by executing Import DefaultKeying GRing.DefaultPred. The required 
     oppr_closed and addr_closed assumptions will be either abstracted,     
     resolved or issued as separate proof obligations by the ssreflect      
     plugin abstraction and Prop-irrelevance functions.                     
<a name="lab5"></a><h1 class="section">Ring (non-commutative rings):</h1>

              ringType == interface type for a Ring structure.              
 RingMixin mulA mul1x mulx1 mulDx mulxD == builds the mixin for a Ring from 
                           the algebraic properties of its multiplicative   
                           operators; the carrier type must have a zmodType 
                           structure.                                       
           RingType R m == packs the ring mixin m into a ringType.          
                    R^c == the converse Ring for R: R^c is convertible to R 
                           but when R has a canonical ringType structure    
                           R^c has the converse one: if x y : R^c, then     
                           x * y = (y : R) * (x : R).                       
  [ringType of R for S] == R-clone of the ringType structure S.             
        [ringType of R] == clone of a canonical ringType structure on R.    
                      1 == the multiplicative identity element of a Ring.   
                   n%:R == the ring image of an n in nat; this is just      
                           notation for 1 *+ n, so 1%:R is convertible to 1 
                           and 2%:R to 1 + 1.                               
                  x * y == the ring product of x and y.                     
        \prod</i>&lt;range&gt; e == iterated product for a ring (cf bigop.v).        
                 x ^+ n == x to the nth power with n in nat (non-negative), 
                           i.e., x * (x * .. (x * x)..) (n factors); x ^+ 1 
                           is thus convertible to x, and x ^+ 2 to x * x.   
         GRing.sign R b := (-1) ^+ b in R : ringType, with b : bool.        
                           This is a parsing-only helper notation, to be    
                           used for defining more specific instances.       
         GRing.comm x y &lt;-&gt; x and y commute, i.e., x * y = y * x.           
           GRing.lreg x &lt;-&gt; x if left-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective.    
           GRing.rreg x &lt;-&gt; x if right-regular, i.e., *%R x is injective.   
               [char R] == the characteristic of R, defined as the set of   
                           prime numbers p such that p%:R = 0 in R. The set 
                           [char p] has a most one element, and is          
                           implemented as a pred_nat collective predicate   
                           (see prime.v); thus the statement p \in [char R] 
                           can be read as `R has characteristic p', while   
                           [char R] =i pred0 means `R has characteristic 0' 
                           when R is a field.                               
     Frobenius_aut chRp == the Frobenius automorphism mapping x in R to     
                           x ^+ p, where chRp : p \in [char R] is a proof   
                           that R has (non-zero) characteristic p.          
          mulr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under finite   
                           products (1 and x * y in S for x, y in S).       
         smulr_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under products 
                           and opposite (-1 and x * y in S for x, y in S).  
      semiring_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under semiring 
                           operations (0, 1, x + y and x * y in S).         
       subring_closed S &lt;-&gt; collective predicate S is closed under ring     
                           operations (1, x - y and x * y in S).            
          MulrPred mulS == packs mulS : mulr_closed S into a mulrPred S,    
        SmulrPred mulS     smulrPred S, semiringPred S, or subringPred S    
     SemiringPred mulS     interface structure, corresponding to the above  
      SubRingPred mulS     properties, respectively, provided S already has 
                           the supplementary zmodType closure properties.   
                           The properties above coerce to subproperties so, 
                           e.g., ringS : subring_closed S can be used for   
                           the proof obligations of all prerequisites.      
 [ringMixin of R by &lt;: ] == ringType mixin for a subType whose base type is  
                           a ringType and whose predicate's canonical key   
                           is a SubringPred.                                
&gt; As for zmodType predicates, Import DefaultKeying GRing.DefaultPred    
      turns unresolved GRing.Pred unification constraints into proof        
      obligations for basic closure assumptions.

            comRingType == interface type for commutative ring structure.

 ComRingMixin mulA mulC mul1x mulDx == builds the mixin for a Ring (i.e., a

                           to reduce the number of proof obligations.

 [unitRingType of R for S] == R-clone of the unitRingType structure S.

               scalar f &lt;-&gt; f of type U -&gt; R is a scalar function, i.e.,    
                           f (a *: u + v) = a * f u + f v.                  
         linear_for s f &lt;-&gt; f is linear for the scaling operator s, i.e.,   
                           f (a *: u + v) = s a (f u) + f v. The range of f 
                           only needs to be a zmodType, but s MUST be of    
                           the form described in in scalable_for paragraph  
                           for this predicate to type check.                
            lmorphism f &lt;-&gt; f is both additive and scalable. This is in     
                           fact equivalent to linear f, although somewhat   
                           less convenient to prove.                        
     lmorphism_for s f &lt;-&gt; f is both additive and scalable for s.           
        {linear U -&gt; V} == the interface type for linear functions, i.e., a 
                           Structure that encapsulates the linear property  
                           for functions f : U -&gt; V; both U and V must have 
                           lmodType R structures, for the same R.           
             {scalar U} == the interface type for scalar functions, of type 
                           U -&gt; R where U has an lmodType R structure.      
    {linear U -&gt; V | s} == the interface type for functions linear for s.   
           Linear lin_f == packs lin_f : lmorphism_for s f into a linear    
                           function structure of type {linear U -&gt; V | s}.  
                           As linear_for s f coerces to lmorphism_for s f,  
                           Linear can be used with lin_f : linear_for s f   
                           (indeed, that is the recommended usage). Note    
                           that as linear f, scalar f, {linear U -&gt; V} and  
                           {scalar U} are simply notation for corresponding 
                           generic "<i>for" forms, Linear can be used for any 
                           of these special cases, transparently.           
       AddLinear scal_f == packs scal_f : scalable_for s f into a           
                           {linear U -&gt; V | s} structure; f must already    
                           have an additive structure; as with Linear,      
                           AddLinear can be used with lin_f : linear f, etc 
     [linear of f as g] == an f-clone of the linear structure of g.         
          [linear of f] == a clone of an existing linear structure on f.    
          (a *: u)%Rlin == transient forms that simplify to a *: u, a * u,  
           (a * u)%Rlin    nu a *: u, and nu a * u, respectively, and are   
       (a *:^nu u)%Rlin    created by rewriting with the linearZ lemma. The 
        (a *^nu u)%Rlin    forms allows the RHS of linearZ to be matched    
                           reliably, using the GRing.Scale.law structure.   
<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; Similarly to Ring morphisms, additive properties are specialized for    
    linear functions.                                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; Although {scalar U} is convertible to {linear U -&gt; R^o}, it does not    
    actually use R^o, so that rewriting preserves the canonical structure   
    of the range of scalar functions.                                       

</li>
<li>&gt; The generic linearZ lemma uses a set of bespoke interface structures to 
    ensure that both left-to-right and right-to-left rewriting work even in 
    the presence of scaling functions that simplify non-trivially (e.g.,    
    idfun \; *%R). Because most of the canonical instances and projections  
    are coercions the machinery will be mostly invisible (with only the     
    {linear ...} structure and %Rlin notations showing), but users should   
    beware that in (a *: f u)%Rlin, a actually occurs in the f u subterm.   

</li>
<li>&gt; The simpler linear_LR, or more specialized linearZZ and scalarZ rules   
    should be used instead of linearZ if there are complexity issues, as    
    well as for explicit forward and backward application, as the main      
    parameter of linearZ is a proper sub-interface of {linear fUV | s}.

<a name="lab20"></a><h1 class="section">LRMorphism (linear ring morphisms, i.e., algebra morphisms):</h1>

           lrmorphism f &lt;-&gt; f of type A -&gt; B is a linear Ring (Algebra)     
                           morphism: f is both additive, multiplicative and 
                           scalable. A and B must both have lalgType R      
                           canonical structures, for the same ringType R.   
     lrmorphism_for s f &lt;-&gt; f a linear Ring morphism for the scaling        
                           operator s: f is additive, multiplicative and    
                           scalable for s. A must be an lalgType R, but B   
                           only needs to have a ringType structure.         
    {lrmorphism A -&gt; B} == the interface type for linear morphisms, i.e., a 
                           Structure that encapsulates the lrmorphism       
                           property for functions f : A -&gt; B; both A and B  
                           must have lalgType R structures, for the same R. 
 {lrmorphism A -&gt; B | s} == the interface type for morphisms linear for s.  
   LRmorphism lrmorph_f == packs lrmorph_f : lrmorphism_for s f into a      
                           linear morphism structure of type                
                           {lrmorphism A -&gt; B | s}. Like Linear, LRmorphism 
                           can be used transparently for lrmorphism f.      
   AddLRmorphism scal_f == packs scal_f : scalable_for s f into a linear    
                           morphism structure of type                       
                           {lrmorphism A -&gt; B | s}; f must already have an  
                           {rmorphism A -&gt; B} structure, and AddLRmorphism  
                           can be applied to a linear_for s f, linear f,    
                           scalar f, etc argument, like AddLinear.          
      [lrmorphism of f] == creates an lrmorphism structure from existing    
                           rmorphism and linear structures on f; this is    
                           the preferred way of creating lrmorphism         
                           structures.                                      
<ul class="doclist">
<li>&gt; Linear and rmorphism properties do not need to be specialized for      
     as we supply inheritance join instances in both directions.            

</li>
</ul>
 Finally we supply some helper notation for morphisms:                      
                    x^f == the image of x under some morphism. This         
                           notation is only reserved (not defined) here;    
                           it is bound locally in sections where some       
                           morphism is used heavily (e.g., the container    
                           morphism in the parametricity sections of poly   
                           and matrix, or the Frobenius section here).      
                     \0 == the constant null function, which has a          
                           canonical linear structure, and simplifies on    
                           application (see ssrfun.v).                      
                 f \+ g == the additive composition of f and g, i.e., the   
                           function x |-&gt; f x + g x; f \+ g is canonically  
                           linear when f and g are, and simplifies on       
                           application (see ssrfun.v).                      
                 f \- g == the function x |-&gt; f x - g x, canonically        
                           linear when f and g are, and simplifies on       
                           application.                                     
                k \*: f == the function x |-&gt; k *: f x, which is            
                           canonically linear when f is and simplifies on   
                           application (this is a shorter alternative to    
                           *:%R k \o f).                                    
         GRing.in_alg A == the ring morphism that injects R into A, where A 
                           has an lalgType R structure; GRing.in_alg A k    
                           simplifies to k%:A.                              
                a \*o f == the function x |-&gt; a * f x, canonically linear   
                           linear when f is and its codomain is an algType  
                           and which simplifies on application.             
                a \o* f == the function x |-&gt; f x * a, canonically linear   
                           linear when f is and its codomain is an lalgType 
                           and which simplifies on application.             
 The Lemmas about these structures are contained in both the GRing module   
 and in the submodule GRing.Theory, which can be imported when unqualified  
 access to the theory is needed (GRing.Theory also allows the unqualified   
 use of additive, linear, Linear, etc). The main GRing module should NOT be 
 imported.                                                                  
   Notations are defined in scope ring_scope (delimiter %R), except term    
 and formula notations, which are in term_scope (delimiter %T).             
   This library also extends the conventional suffixes described in library 
 ssrbool.v with the following:                                              
   0 -- ring 0, as in addr0 : x + 0 = x.                                    
   1 -- ring 1, as in mulr1 : x * 1 = x.                                    
   D -- ring addition, as in linearD : f (u + v) = f u + f v.               
   B -- ring subtraction, as in opprB : - (x - y) = y - x.                  
   M -- ring multiplication, as in invfM : (x * y)^-1 = x^-1 * y^-1.        
  Mn -- ring by nat multiplication, as in raddfMn : f (x *+ n) = f x *+ n.  
   N -- ring opposite, as in mulNr : (- x) * y = - (x * y).                 
   V -- ring inverse, as in mulVr : x^-1 * x = 1.                           
   X -- ring exponentiation, as in rmorphX : f (x ^+ n) = f x ^+ n.         
   Z -- (left) module scaling, as in linearZ : f (a *: v)  = s *: f v.      
 The operator suffixes D, B, M and X are also used for the corresponding    
 operations on nat, as in natrX : (m ^ n)%:R = m%:R ^+ n. For the binary    
 power operator, a trailing "n" suffix is used to indicate the operator     
 suffix applies to the left-hand ring argument, as in                       
   expr1n : 1 ^+ n = 1 vs. expr1 : x ^+ 1 = x.

<div class="doc">
   The general form of the linearZ lemma uses some bespoke interfaces to   
 allow right-to-left rewriting when a composite scaling operation such as  
 conjC \; *%R has been expanded, say in a^* * f u. This redex is matched   
 by using the Scale.law interface to recognize a "head" scaling operation  
 h (here *%R), stow away its "scalar" c, then reconcile h c and s a, once  
 s is known, that is, once the Linear.map structure for f has been found.  
 In general, s and a need not be equal to h and c; indeed they need not    
 have the same type! The unification is performed by the unify_map_at      
 default instance for the Linear.map_for U s a h_c sub-interface of        
 Linear.map; the h_c pattern uses the Scale.law structure to insure it is  
 inferred when rewriting right-to-left.                                    
   The wrap on the rhs allows rewriting f (a *: b *: u) into a *: b *: f u 
 with rewrite !linearZ /= instead of rewrite linearZ /= linearZ /=.        
 Without it, the first rewrite linearZ would produce                       
    (a *: apply (map_for_map (@check_map_at .. a f)) (b *: u)%R)%Rlin      
 and matching the second rewrite LHS would bypass the unify_map_at default 
 instance for b, reuse the one for a, and subsequently fail to match the   
 b *: u argument. The extra wrap / unwrap ensures that this can't happen.  
 In the RL direction, the wrap / unwrap will be inserted on the redex side 
 as needed, without causing unnecessary delta-expansion: using an explicit 
 identity function would have Coq normalize the redex to head normal, then 
 reduce the identity to expose the map_for_map projection, and the         
 expanded Linear.map structure would then be exposed in the result.        
   Most of this machinery will be invisible to a casual user, because all  
 the projections and default instances involved are declared as coercions.
