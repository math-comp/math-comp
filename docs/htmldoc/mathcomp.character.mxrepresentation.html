  This file provides linkage between classic Group Theory and commutative   
 algebra -- representation theory. Since general abstract linear algebra is 
 still being sorted out, we develop the required theory here on the         
 assumption that all vector spaces are matrix spaces, indeed that most are  
 row matrix spaces; our representation theory is specialized to the latter  
 case. We provide many definitions and results of representation theory:    
 enveloping algebras, reducible, irreducible and absolutely irreducible     
 representations, representation centralisers, submodules and kernels,      
 simple and semisimple modules, the Schur lemmas, Maschke's theorem,        
 components, socles, homomorphisms and isomorphisms, the Jacobson density   
 theorem, similar representations, the Jordan-Holder theorem, Clifford's    
 theorem and Wedderburn components, regular representations and the         
 Wedderburn structure theorem for semisimple group rings, and the           
 construction of a splitting field of an irreducible representation, and of 
 reduced, tensored, and factored representations.                           
 mx_representation F G n == the Structure type for representations of G     
                 with n x n matrices with coefficients in F. Note that      
                 rG : mx_representation F G n coerces to a function from    
                 the element type of G to 'M_n, and conversely all such     
                 functions have a Canonical mx_representation.              
  mx_repr G r &lt;-&gt; r : gT -&gt; 'M_n defines a (matrix) group representation    
                 on G : {set gT} (Prop predicate).                          
 enveloping_algebra_mx rG == a #|G| x (n ^ 2) matrix whose rows are the     
                 mxvec encodings of the image of G under rG, and whose      
                 row space therefore encodes the enveloping algebra of      
                 the representation of G.                                   
      rker rG == the kernel of the representation of r on G, i.e., the      
                 subgroup of elements of G mapped to the identity by rG.    
 mx_faithful rG == the representation rG of G is faithful (its kernel is    
                 trivial).                                                  
 rfix_mx rG H == an n x n matrix whose row space is the set of vectors      
                 fixed (centralised) by the representation of H by rG.      
   rcent rG A == the subgroup of G whose representation via rG commutes     
                 with the square matrix A.                                  
   rcenter rG == the subgroup of G whose representation via rG consists of  
                 scalar matrices.                                           
 centgmx rG f &lt;=&gt; f commutes with every matrix in the representation of G   
                 (i.e., f is a total rG-homomorphism).                      
   rstab rG U == the subgroup of G whose representation via r fixes all     
                 vectors in U, pointwise.                                   
  rstabs rG U == the subgroup of G whose representation via r fixes the row 
                 space of U globally.                                       
 mxmodule rG U &lt;=&gt; the row-space of the matrix U is a module (globally      
                 invariant) under the representation rG of G.               
 max_submod rG U V &lt;-&gt; U &lt; V is not a proper is a proper subset of any      
                 proper rG-submodule of V (if both U and V are modules,     
                 then U is a maximal proper submodule of V).                
 mx_subseries rG Us &lt;=&gt; Us : seq 'M_n is a list of rG-modules               
 mx_composition_series rG Us &lt;-&gt; Us is an increasing composition series     
                 for an rG-module (namely, last 0 Us).                      
 mxsimple rG M &lt;-&gt; M is a simple rG-module (i.e., minimal and nontrivial)   
                 This is a Prop predicate on square matrices.               
 mxnonsimple rG U &lt;-&gt; U is constructively not a submodule, that is, U       
                 contains a proper nontrivial submodule.                    
 mxnonsimple_sat rG U == U is not a simple as an rG-module.                 
                 This is a bool predicate, which requires a decField        
                 structure on the scalar field.                             
 mxsemisimple rG W &lt;-&gt; W is constructively a direct sum of simple modules.  
 mxsplits rG V U &lt;-&gt; V splits over U in rG, i.e., U has an rG-invariant     
                 complement in V.                                           
 mx_completely_reducible rG V &lt;-&gt; V splits over all its submodules; note    
                 that this is only classically equivalent to stating that   
                 V is semisimple.                                           
 mx_irreducible rG &lt;-&gt; the representation rG is irreducible, i.e., the full 
                 module 1%:M of rG is simple.                               
 mx_absolutely_irreducible rG == the representation rG of G is absolutely   
                 irreducible: its enveloping algebra is the full matrix     
                 ring. This is only classically equivalent to the more      
                 standard ``rG does not reduce in any field extension''.    
 group_splitting_field F G &lt;-&gt; F is a splitting field for the group G:      
                 every irreducible representation of G is absolutely        
                 irreducible. Any field can be embedded classically into a  
                 splitting field.                                           
 group_closure_field F gT &lt;-&gt; F is a splitting field for every group        
                 G : {group gT}, and indeed for any section of such a       
                 group. This is a convenient constructive substitute for    
                 algebraic closures, that can be constructed classically.   
 dom_hom_mx rG f == a square matrix encoding the set of vectors for which   
                 multiplication by the n x n matrix f commutes with the     
                 representation of G, i.e., the largest domain on which     
                 f is an rG homomorphism.                                   
   mx_iso rG U V &lt;-&gt; U and V are (constructively) rG-isomorphic; this is    
                 a Prop predicate.                                          
 mx_simple_iso rG U V == U and V are rG-isomorphic if one of them is        
                 simple; this is a bool predicate.                          
  cyclic_mx rG u == the cyclic rG-module generated by the row vector u      
 annihilator_mx rG u == the annihilator of the row vector u in the          
                 enveloping algebra the representation rG.                  
 row_hom_mx rG u == the image of u by the set of all rG-homomorphisms on    
                 its cyclic module, or, equivalently, the null-space of the 
                 annihilator of u.                                          
 component_mx rG M == when M is a simple rG-module, the component of M in   
                 the representation rG, i.e. the module generated by all    
                 the (simple) modules rG-isomorphic to M.                   
    socleType rG == a Structure that represents the type of all components  
                 of rG (more precisely, it coerces to such a type via       
                 socle_sort). For sG : socleType, values of type sG (to be  
                 exact, socle_sort sG) coerce to square matrices. For any   
                 representation rG we can construct sG : socleType rG       
                 classically; the socleType structure encapsulates this     
                 use of classical logic.                                    
 DecSocleType rG == a socleType rG structure, for a representation over a   
                 decidable field type. DecSocleType rG is opaque.           
    socle_base W == for W : (sG : socleType), a simple module whose         
                 component is W; socle_simple W and socle_module W are      
                 proofs that socle_base W is a simple module.               
    socle_mult W == the multiplicity of socle_base W in W : sG.             
                 := \rank W %/ \rank (socle_base W)                         
        Socle sG == the Socle of rG, given sG : socleType rG, i.e., the     
                 (direct) sum of all the components of rG.                  
 mx_rsim rG rG' &lt;-&gt; rG and rG' are similar representations of the same      
                 group G. Note that rG and rG' must then have equal, but    
                 not necessarily convertible, degree.                       
 submod_repr modU == a representation of G on 'rV(\rank U) equivalent to   
                 the restriction of rG to U (here modU : mxmodule rG U).    
    socle_repr W := submod_repr (socle_module W)                            
 val/in_submod rG U == the projections resp. from/onto 'rV(\rank U),       
                 that correspond to submod_repr r G U (these work both on   
                 vectors and row spaces).                                   
 factmod_repr modV == a representation of G on 'rV(\rank (cokermx V)) that 
                 is equivalent to the factor module 'rV_n / V induced by V  
                 and rG (here modV : mxmodule rG V).                        
 val/in_factmod rG U == the projections for factmod_repr r G U.             
 section_repr modU modV == the restriction to in_factmod V U of the factor  
                 representation factmod_repr modV (for modU : mxmodule rG U 
                 and modV : mxmodule rG V); section_repr modU modV is       
                 irreducible iff max_submod rG U V.                         
 subseries_repr modUs i == the representation for the section module        
                 in_factmod (0 :: Us)`<i>i Us`<i>i, where                       
                 modUs : mx_subseries rG Us.

                 in_factmod (0 :: Us)`<i>i Us`<i>i, where                       
                 compUs : mx_composition_series rG Us. The Jordan-Holder    
                 theorem asserts the uniqueness of the set of such          
                 representations, up to similarity and permutation.         
 regular_repr F G == the regular F-representation of the group G.           
   group_ring F G == a #|G| x #|G|^2 matrix that encodes the free group     
                 ring of G -- that is, the enveloping algebra of the

   gring_index x == the index corresponding to x \in G in the matrix        
                 encoding of regular_repr and group_ring.                   
     gring_row A == the row vector corresponding to A \in group_ring F G in 
                 the regular FG-module.                                     
  gring_proj x A == the 1 x 1 matrix holding the coefficient of x \in G in  
                 (A \in group_ring F G)%MS.                                 
   gring_mx rG u == the image of a row vector u of the regular FG-module,   
                 in the enveloping algebra of another representation rG.    
   gring_op rG A == the image of a matrix of the free group ring of G,      
                 in the enveloping algebra of rG.                           
   gset_mx F G C == the group sum of C in the free group ring of G -- the   
                 sum of the images of all the x \in C in group_ring F G.    
 classg_base F G == a #|classes G| x #|G|^2 matrix whose rows encode the    
                 group sums of the conjugacy classes of G -- this is a      
                 basis of 'Z(group_ring F G)%MS.

                 field F, provided its characteristic does not divide the   
                 order of G; it also indexes Wedderburn subrings.           
                 :=  socleType (regular_repr F G)                           
      irr_repr i == the irreducible representation corresponding to the     
                 index i : irrType sG                                       
                 := socle_repr i as i coerces to a component matrix.

   linear_irr sG == the set of sG-indices of linear irreducible

  irr_comp sG rG == the sG-index of the unique irreducible representation   
                 similar to rG, at least when rG is irreducible and the     
                 characteristic is coprime.                                 
    irr_mode i z == the unique eigenvalue of irr_repr i z, at least when

      [1 sG]%irr == the index of the principal representation of G, in      
                 sG : irrType F G. The i argument of irr_repr, irr_degree   
                 and irr_mode is in the %irr scope. This notation may be    
                 replaced locally by an interpretation of 1%irr as [1 sG]   
                 for some specific irrType sG.

                 free group ring of G corresponding to the component i : sG 
                 of the regular FG-module, where sG : irrType F g. In       
                 coprime characteristic the Wedderburn structure theorem    
                 asserts that the free group ring is the direct sum of      
                 these subrings; as with 'n_i above, the notation is only   
                 active in group_ring_scope.                                
 'e_i, Wedderburn_id i == the projection of the identity matrix 1%:M on the 
                 Wedderburn subring of i : sG (with sG a socleType). In     
                 coprime characteristic this is the identity element of     
                 the subring, and the basis of its center if the field F is 
                 a splitting field. As 'R_i, 'e_i is in group_ring_scope.   
 subg_repr rG sHG == the restriction to H of the representation rG of G;    
                 here sHG : H \subset G.

 map_repr f rG == the representation f \o rG, whose module is the tensor    
                 product of the module of rG with the extension field into  
                 which f : {rmorphism F -&gt; Fstar} embeds F.                 
      'Cl%act == the transitive action of G on the Wedderburn components of 
                 H, with nsGH : H &lt;| G, given by Clifford's theorem. More   
                 precisely this is a total action of G on socle_sort sH,    
                 where sH : socleType (subg_repr rG (normal_sub sGH)).      
 We build on the MatrixFormula toolkit to define decision procedures for    
 the reducibility property:                                                 
  mxmodule_form rG U == a formula asserting that the interpretation of U is 
                 a module of the representation rG.                         
  mxnonsimple_form rG U == a formula asserting that the interpretation of U 
                 contains a proper nontrivial rG-module.                    
  mxnonsimple_sat rG U &lt;=&gt; mxnonsimple_form rG U is satisfied.              
 More involved constructions are encapsulated in two Coq submodules:        
 MatrixGenField == a module that encapsulates the lengthy details of the    
                 construction of appropriate extension fields. We assume we 
                 have an irreducible representation rG of a group G, and a  
                 non-scalar matrix A that centralises rG(G), as this data   
                 is readily extracted from the Jacobson density theorem. It 
                 then follows from Schur's lemma that the ring generated by 
                 A is a field on which the extension of the representation  
                 rG of G is reducible. Note that this is equivalent to the  
                 more traditional quotient of the polynomial ring by an     
                 irreducible polynomial (the minimal polynomial of A), but  
                 much better suited to our needs.                           
   Here are the main definitions of MatrixGenField; they all have three     
 proofs as arguments: (implicit) rG : mx_repr n G, irrG : mx_irreducible rG 
 and cGA : centgmx rG A. These ensure the validity of the construction and  
 allow us to define Canonical instances; we assume degree_mxminpoly A &gt; 1   
 (which is equivalent to ~~ is_scalar_mx A) only to prove reducibility.     
  + gen_of irrG cGA == the carrier type of the field generated by A. It is  
                 at least equipped with a fieldType structure; we also      
                 propagate any decFieldType/finFieldType structures on the  
                 original field.                                            
  + gen irrG cGA == the morphism injecting into gen_of irrG cGA.            
  + groot irrG cGA == the root of mxminpoly A in the gen_of irrG cGA field. 
  + pval x, rVval x, mxval x == the interpretation of x : gen_of irrG cGA   
                 as a polynomial, a row vector, and a matrix, respectively. 
                 Both irrG and cGA are implicit arguments here.             
  + gen_repr irrG cGA == an alternative to the field extension              
                 representation, which consists in reconsidering the        
                 original module as a module over the new gen_of field,     
                 thereby DIVIDING the original dimension n by the degree of 
                 the minimal polynomial of A. This can be simpler than the  
                 extension method, is actually required by the proof that   
                 odd groups are p-stable (B &amp; G 6.1-2, and Appendix A), but 
                 is only applicable if G is the LARGEST group represented   
                 by rG (e.g., NOT for B &amp; G 2.6).                           
  + gen_dim A == the dimension of gen_repr irrG cGA (only depends on A).    
  + in_gen irrG cGA W == the ROWWISE image of a matrix W : 'M[F]</i>(m, n),    
                 i.e., interpreting W as a sequence of m tow vectors,       
                 under the bijection from rG to gen_repr irrG cGA.          
                 The sequence length m is a maximal implicit argument       
                 passed between the explicit argument cGA and W.            
  + val_gen W == the ROWWISE image of an 'M[gen_of irrG cGA](m, gen_dim A) 
                 matrix W under the bijection from gen_repr irrG cGA to rG. 
  + rowval_gen W == the ROWSPACE image of W under the bijection from        
                 gen_repr irrG cGA to rG, i.e., a 'M[F]_n matrix whose row  
                 space is the image of the row space of W.                  
                 This is the A-ideal generated by val_gen W.                
  + gen_sat e f &lt;=&gt; f : GRing.formula (gen_of irrG cGA) is satisfied in     
                 environment e : seq (gen_of irrG cGA), provided F has a    
                 decFieldType structure.                                    
  + gen_env e, gen_term t, gen_form f == interpretations of environments,   
                 terms, and RING formulas over gen_of irrG cGA as row       
                 vector formulae, used to construct gen_sat.

 Sub-, isomorphic, simple, semisimple and completely reducible modules.     
 All these predicates are intuitionistic (since, e.g., testing simplicity   
 requires a splitting algorithm fo r the mas field). They are all           
 specialized to square matrices, to avoid spurrious height parameters.       
<div class="paragraph"> </div>

  Module isomorphism is an intentional property in general, but it can be    
 decided when one of the two modules is known to be simple.

 Construction of a splitting field FA of an irreducible representation, for 
 a matrix A in the centraliser of the representation. FA is the row-vector  
 space of the matrix algebra generated by A with basis 1, A, ..., A ^+ d.-1 
 or, equivalently, the polynomials in {poly F} taken mod the (irreducible)  
 minimal polynomial pA of A (of degree d).                                  
 The details of the construction of FA are encapsulated in a submodule.

 An alternative to the above, used in the proof of the p-stability of       
 groups of odd order, is to reconsider the original vector space as a       
 vector space of dimension n / e over FA. This is applicable only if G is   
 the largest group represented on the original vector space (i.e., if we    
 are not studying a representation of G induced by one of a larger group,   
 as in B &amp; G Theorem 2.6 for instance). We can't fully exploit one of the   
 benefits of this approach -- that the type domain for the vector space can 
 remain unchanged -- because we're restricting ourselves to row matrices;   
 we have to use explicit bijections to convert between the two views.
