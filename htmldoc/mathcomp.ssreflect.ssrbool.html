 A theory of boolean predicates and operators. A large part of this file is 
 concerned with boolean reflection.                                         
 Definitions and notations:                                                 
               is_true b == the coercion of b : bool to Prop (:= b = true). 
                            This is just input and displayed as `b''.       
             reflect P b == the reflection inductive predicate, asserting   
                            that the logical proposition P : prop with the  
                            formula b : bool. Lemmas asserting reflect P b  
                            are often referred to as "views".               
  iffP, appP, sameP, rwP :: lemmas for direct manipulation of reflection    
                            views: iffP is used to prove reflection from    
                            logical equivalence, appP to compose views, and 
                            sameP and rwP to perform boolean and setoid     
                            rewriting.                                      
                   elimT :: coercion reflect &gt;-&gt; Funclass, which allows the 
                            direct application of `reflect' views to        
                            boolean assertions.                             
             decidable P &lt;-&gt; P is effectively decidable (:= {P} + {~ P}.    
    contra, contraL, ... :: contraposition lemmas.                          
           altP my_viewP :: natural alternative for reflection; given       
                            lemma myviewP: reflect my_Prop my_formula,      
                              have [myP | not_myP] := altP my_viewP.        
                            generates two subgoals, in which my_formula has 
                            been replaced by true and false, resp., with    
                            new assumptions myP : my_Prop and               
                            not_myP: ~~ my_formula.                         
                            Caveat: my_formula must be an APPLICATION, not  
                            a variable, constant, let-in, etc. (due to the  
                            poor behaviour of dependent index matching).    
        boolP my_formula :: boolean disjunction, equivalent to              
                            altP (idP my_formula) but circumventing the     
                            dependent index capture issue; destructing      
                            boolP my_formula generates two subgoals with    
                            assumtions my_formula and ~~ myformula. As      
                            with altP, my_formula must be an application.   
            \unless C, P &lt;-&gt; we can assume property P when a something that 
                            holds under condition C (such as C itself).     
                         := forall G : Prop, (C -&gt; G) -&gt; (P -&gt; G) -&gt; G.     
                            This is just C \/ P or rather its impredicative 
                            encoding, whose usage better fits the above     
                            description: given a lemma UCP whose conclusion 
                            is \unless C, P we can assume P by writing:     
                              wlog hP: / P by apply/UCP; (prove C -&gt; goal). 
                           or even apply: UCP id _ =&gt; hP if the goal is C.  
           classically P &lt;-&gt; we can assume P when proving is_true b.        
                         := forall b : bool, (P -&gt; b) -&gt; b.                 
                            This is equivalent to ~ (~ P) when P : Prop.    
             implies P Q == wrapper coinductive type that coerces to P -&gt; Q 
                            and can be used as a P -&gt; Q view unambigously.  
                            Useful to avoid spurious insertion of &lt;-&gt; views 
                            when Q is a conjunction of foralls, as in Lemma 
                            all_and2 below; conversely, avoids confusion in 
                            apply views for impredicative properties, such  
                            as \unless C, P. Also supports contrapositives. 
                  a &amp;&amp; b == the boolean conjunction of a and b.             
                  a || b == the boolean disjunction of a and b.             
                 a ==&gt; b == the boolean implication of b by a.              
                    ~~ a == the boolean negation of a.                      
                 a (+) b == the boolean exclusive or (or sum) of a and b.   
     [ /\ P1 , P2 &amp; P3 ] == multiway logical conjunction, up to 5 terms.    
     [ \/ P1 , P2 | P3 ] == multiway logical disjunction, up to 4 terms.    
        [&amp;&amp; a, b, c &amp; d] == iterated, right associative boolean conjunction 
                            with arbitrary arity.                           
        [|| a, b, c | d] == iterated, right associative boolean disjunction 
                            with arbitrary arity.                           
      [==&gt; a, b, c =&gt; d] == iterated, right associative boolean implication 
                            with arbitrary arity.                           
              and3P, ... == specific reflection lemmas for iterated         
                            connectives.                                    
       andTb, orbAC, ... == systematic names for boolean connective         
                            properties (see suffix conventions below).      
              prop_congr == a tactic to move a boolean equality from        
                            its coerced form in Prop to the equality        
                            in bool.                                        
              bool_congr == resolution tactic for blindly weeding out       
                            like terms from boolean equalities (can fail).  
 This file provides a theory of boolean predicates and relations:           
                  pred T == the type of bool predicates (:= T -&gt; bool).     
            simpl_pred T == the type of simplifying bool predicates, using  
                            the simpl_fun from ssrfun.v.                    
                   rel T == the type of bool relations.                     
                         := T -&gt; pred T or T -&gt; T -&gt; bool.                  
             simpl_rel T == type of simplifying relations.                  
                predType == the generic predicate interface, supported for  
                            for lists and sets.                             
              pred_class == a coercion class for the predType projection to 
                            pred; declaring a coercion to pred_class is an  
                            alternative way of equipping a type with a      
                            predType structure, which interoperates better  
                            with coercion subtyping. This is used, e.g.,    
                            for finite sets, so that finite groups inherit  
                            the membership operation by coercing to sets.   
 If P is a predicate the proposition "x satisfies P" can be written         
 applicatively as (P x), or using an explicit connective as (x \in P); in   
 the latter case we say that P is a "collective" predicate. We use A, B     
 rather than P, Q for collective predicates:                                
                 x \in A == x satisfies the (collective) predicate A.       
              x \notin A == x doesn't satisfy the (collective) predicate A. 
 The pred T type can be used as a generic predicate type for either kind,   
 but the two kinds of predicates should not be confused. When a "generic"   
 pred T value of one type needs to be passed as the other the following     
 conversions should be used explicitly:                                     
             SimplPred P == a (simplifying) applicative equivalent of P.    
                   mem A == an applicative equivalent of A:                 
                            mem A x simplifies to x \in A.                  
 Alternatively one can use the syntax for explicit simplifying predicates   
 and relations (in the following x is bound in E):                          
            [pred x | E] == simplifying (see ssrfun) predicate x =&gt; E.      
        [pred x : T | E] == predicate x =&gt; T, with a cast on the argument.  
          [pred : T | P] == constant predicate P on type T.                 
      [pred x | E1 &amp; E2] == [pred x | E1 &amp;&amp; E2]; an x : T cast is allowed.  
           [pred x in A] == [pred x | x in A].                              
       [pred x in A | E] == [pred x | x in A &amp; E].                          
 [pred x in A | E1 &amp; E2] == [pred x in A | E1 &amp;&amp; E2].                       
           [predU A &amp; B] == union of two collective predicates A and B.     
           [predI A &amp; B] == intersection of collective predicates A and B.  
           [predD A &amp; B] == difference of collective predicates A and B.    
               [predC A] == complement of the collective predicate A.       
          [preim f of A] == preimage under f of the collective predicate A. 
          predU P Q, ... == union, etc of applicative predicates.           
                   pred0 == the empty predicate.                            
                   predT == the total (always true) predicate.              
                            if T : predArgType, then T coerces to predT.    
                   {: T} == T cast to predArgType (e.g., {: bool * nat})    
 In the following, x and y are bound in E:                                  
           [rel x y | E] == simplifying relation x, y =&gt; E.                 
       [rel x y : T | E] == simplifying relation with arguments cast.       
  [rel x y in A &amp; B | E] == [rel x y | [&amp;&amp; x \in A, y \in B &amp; E] ].          
      [rel x y in A &amp; B] == [rel x y | (x \in A) &amp;&amp; (y \in B) ].             
      [rel x y in A | E] == [rel x y in A &amp; A | E].                         
          [rel x y in A] == [rel x y in A &amp; A].                             
                relU R S == union of relations R and S.                     
 Explicit values of type pred T (i.e., lamdba terms) should always be used  
 applicatively, while values of collection types implementing the predType  
 interface, such as sequences or sets should always be used as collective   
 predicates. Defined constants and functions of type pred T or simpl_pred T 
 as well as the explicit simpl_pred T values described below, can generally 
 be used either way. Note however that x \in A will not auto-simplify when  
 A is an explicit simpl_pred T value; the generic simplification rule inE   
 must be used (when A : pred T, the unfold_in rule can be used). Constants  
 of type pred T with an explicit simpl_pred value do not auto-simplify when 
 used applicatively, but can still be expanded with inE. This behavior can  
 be controlled as follows:                                                  
   Let A : collective_pred T := [pred x | ... ].                            
     The collective_pred T type is just an alias for pred T, but this cast  
     stops rewrite inE from expanding the definition of A, thus treating A  
     into an abstract collection (unfold_in or in_collective can be used to 
     expand manually).                                                      
   Let A : applicative_pred T := [pred x | ... ].                            
     This cast causes inE to turn x \in A into the applicative A x form;    
     A will then have to unfolded explicitly with the /A rule. This will    
     also apply to any definition that reduces to A (e.g., Let B := A).     
   Canonical A_app_pred := ApplicativePred A.                               
     This declaration, given after definition of A, similarly causes inE to 
     turn x \in A into A x, but in addition allows the app_predE rule to    
     turn A x back into x \in A; it can be used for any definition of type  
     pred T, which makes it especially useful for ambivalent predicates     
     as the relational transitive closure connect, that are used in both    
     applicative and collective styles.                                     
 Purely for aesthetics, we provide a subtype of collective predicates:      
   qualifier q T == a pred T pretty-printing wrapper. An A : qualifier q T  
                    coerces to pred_class and thus behaves as a collective  
                    predicate, but x \in A and x \notin A are displayed as: 
             x \is A and x \isn't A when q = 0,                             
         x \is a A and x \isn't a A when q = 1,                             
       x \is an A and x \isn't an A when q = 2, respectively.               
   [qualify x | P] := Qualifier 0 (fun x =&gt; P), constructor for the above.  
 [qualify x : T | P], [qualify a x | P], [qualify an X | P], etc.           
                  variants of the above with type constraints and different 
                  values of q.                                              
 We provide an internal interface to support attaching properties (such as  
 being multiplicative) to predicates:                                       
    pred_key p == phantom type that will serve as a support for properties  
                  to be attached to p : pred_class; instances should be     
                  created with Fact/Qed so as to be opaque.                 
 KeyedPred k_p == an instance of the interface structure that attaches      
                  (k_p : pred_key P) to P; the structure projection is a    
                  coercion to pred_class.                                   
 KeyedQualifier k_q == an instance of the interface structure that attaches 
                  (k_q : pred_key q) to (q : qualifier n T).                
 DefaultPredKey p == a default value for pred_key p; the vernacular command 
                  Import DefaultKeying attaches this key to all predicates  
                  that are not explicitly keyed.                            
 Keys can be used to attach properties to predicates, qualifiers and        
 generic nouns in a way that allows them to be used transparently. The key  
 projection of a predicate property structure such as unsignedPred should   
 be a pred_key, not a pred, and corresponding lemmas will have the form     
    Lemma rpredN R S (oppS : @opprPred R S) (kS : keyed_pred oppS) :        
       {mono -%R: x / x \in kS}.                                            
 Because x \in kS will be displayed as x \in S (or x \is S, etc), the       
 canonical instance of opprPred will not normally be exposed (it will also  
 be erased by /= simplification). In addition each predicate structure

 We introduce a number of n-ary "list-style" notations that share a common  
 format, namely                                                             
    [op arg1, arg2, ... last_separator last_arg]                            
 This usually denotes a right-associative applications of op, e.g.,         
  [&amp;&amp; a, b, c &amp; d] denotes a &amp;&amp; (b &amp;&amp; (c &amp;&amp; d))                             
 The last_separator must be a non-operator token. Here we use &amp;, | or =&gt;;   
 our default is &amp;, but we try to match the intended meaning of op. The      
 separator is a workaround for limitations of the parsing engine; the same  
 limitations mean the separator cannot be omitted even when last_arg can.   
   The Notation declarations are complicated by the separate treatment for  
 some fixed arities (binary for bool operators, and all arities for Prop    
 operators).                                                                
   We also use the square brackets in comprehension-style notations         
    [type var separator expr]                                               
 where "type" is the type of the comprehension (e.g., pred) and "separator" 
 is | or =&gt; . It is important that in other notations a leading square      
 bracket [ is always followed by an operator symbol or a fixed identifier.

 Lemmas for ifs with large conditions, which allow reasoning about the  
 condition without repeating it inside the proof (the latter IS         
 preferable when the condition is short).                               
 Usage :                                                                
   if the goal contains (if cond then ...) = ...                        
     case: ifP =&gt; Hcond.                                                
   generates two subgoal, with the assumption Hcond : cond = true/false 
     Rewrite if_same  eliminates redundant ifs                          
     Rewrite (fun_if f) moves a function f inside an if                 
     Rewrite if_arg moves an argument inside a function-valued if

 List notations for wider connectives; the Prop connectives have a fixed    
 width so as to avoid iterated destruction (we go up to width 5 for /\, and 
 width 4 for or). The bool connectives have arbitrary widths, but denote    
 expressions that associate to the RIGHT. This is consistent with the right 
 associativity of list expressions and thus more convenient in most proofs.

 Predicates, i.e., packaged functions to bool.                              

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> pred T, the basic type for predicates over a type T, is simply an alias

</ul>
 for T -&gt; bool.                                                             
 We actually distinguish two kinds of predicates, which we call applicative 
 and collective, based on the syntax used to test them at some x in T:      

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> For an applicative predicate P, one uses prefix syntax:                  
     P x                                                                    
   Also, most operations on applicative predicates use prefix syntax as     
   well (e.g., predI P Q).                                                  

</li>
<li> For a collective predicate A, one uses infix syntax:                     
     x \in A                                                                
   and all operations on collective predicates use infix syntax as well     
   (e.g., [predI A &amp; B]).                                                   

</li>
</ul>
 There are only two kinds of applicative predicates:                        

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> pred T, the alias for T -&gt; bool mentioned above                          

</li>
<li> simpl_pred T, an alias for simpl_fun T bool with a coercion to pred T    
   that auto-simplifies on application (see ssrfun).                        

</li>
</ul>
 On the other hand, the set of collective predicate types is open-ended via 

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> predType T, a Structure that can be used to put Canonical collective

   finite sets, etc.                                                        

</li>
</ul>
 Indeed, we define such interpretations for applicative predicate types,    
 which can therefore also be used with the infix syntax, e.g.,              
     x \in predI P Q                                                        
 Moreover these infix forms are convertible to their prefix counterpart     
 (e.g., predI P Q x which in turn simplifies to P x &amp;&amp; Q x). The converse   
 is not true, however; collective predicate types cannot, in general, be    
 general, be used applicatively, because of the "uniform inheritance"       
 restriction on implicit coercions.                                         
   However, we do define an explicit generic coercion                       

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> mem : forall (pT : predType), pT -&gt; mem_pred T                           
   where mem_pred T is a variant of simpl_pred T that preserves the infix   
   syntax, i.e., mem A x auto-simplifies to x \in A.                        

</li>
</ul>
 Indeed, the infix "collective" operators are notation for a prefix         
 operator with arguments of type mem_pred T or pred T, applied to coerced   
 collective predicates, e.g.,                                               
      Notation "x \in A" := (in_mem x (mem A)).                             
 This prevents the variability in the predicate type from interfering with  
 the application of generic lemmas. Moreover this also makes it much easier 
 to define generic lemmas, because the simplest type -- pred T -- can be    
 used as the type of generic collective predicates, provided one takes care 
 not to use it applicatively; this avoids the burden of having to declare a 
 different predicate type for each predicate parameter of each section or   
 lemma.                                                                     
   This trick is made possible by the fact that the constructor of the      
 mem_pred T type aligns the unification process, forcing a generic          
 "collective" predicate A : pred T to unify with the actual collective B,   
 which mem has coerced to pred T via an internal, hidden implicit coercion, 
 supplied by the predType structure for B. Users should take care not to    
 inadvertently "strip" (mem B) down to the coerced B, since this will       
 expose the internal coercion: Coq will display a term B x that cannot be   
 typed as such. The topredE lemma can be used to restore the x \in B        
 syntax in this case. While -topredE can conversely be used to change       
 x \in P into P x, it is safer to use the inE and memE lemmas instead, as   
 they do not run the risk of exposing internal coercions. As a consequence  
 it is better to explicitly cast a generic applicative pred T to simpl_pred 
 using the SimplPred constructor, when it is used as a collective predicate 
 (see, e.g., Lemma eq_big in bigop).                                        
   We also sometimes "instantiate" the predType structure by defining a     
 coercion to the sort of the predPredType structure. This works better for  
 types such as {set T} that have subtypes that coerce to them, since the    
 same coercion will be inserted by the application of mem. It also lets us  
 turn any Type aT : predArgType into the total predicate over that type,    
 i.e., fun _: aT =&gt; true. This allows us to write, e.g., #|'I_n| for the    
 cardinal of the (finite) type of integers less than n.                     
   Collective predicates have a specific extensional equality,              

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> A =i B,                                                                

</li>
</ul>
 while applicative predicates use the extensional equality of functions,    

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> P =1 Q                                                                 

</li>
</ul>
 The two forms are convertible, however.                                    
 We lift boolean operations to predicates, defining:                        

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> predU (union), predI (intersection), predC (complement),                 
   predD (difference), and preim (preimage, i.e., composition)              

</li>
</ul>
 For each operation we define three forms, typically:                       

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> predU : pred T -&gt; pred T -&gt; simpl_pred T                                 

</li>
<li> [predU A &amp; B], a Notation for predU (mem A) (mem B)                      

</li>
<li> xpredU, a Notation for the lambda-expression inside predU,               
     which is mostly useful as an argument of =1, since it exposes the head 
     head constant of the expression to the ssreflect matching algorithm.   

</li>
</ul>
 The syntax for the preimage of a collective predicate A is                 

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> [preim f of A]                                                           

</li>
</ul>
 Finally, the generic syntax for defining a simpl_pred T is                 

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> [pred x : T | P(x) ], [pred x | P(x) ], [pred x in A | P(x) ], etc.         

</li>
</ul>
 We also support boolean relations, but only the applicative form, with     
 types                                                                      

<div class="paragraph"> </div>

<ul class="doclist">
<li> rel T, an alias for T -&gt; pred T                                          

</li>
<li> simpl_rel T, an auto-simplifying version, and syntax                     
   [rel x y | P(x,y) ], [rel x y in A &amp; B | P(x,y) ], etc.                    

</li>
</ul>
 The notation [rel of fA] can be used to coerce a function returning a      
 collective predicate to one returning pred T.                              
   Finally, note that there is specific support for ambivalent predicates   
 that can work in either style, as per this file's head descriptor.

 This redundant coercion lets us "inherit" the simpl_predType canonical    
 instance by declaring a coercion to simpl_pred. This hack is the only way 
 to put a predType structure on a predArgType. We use simpl_pred rather    
 than pred to ensure that /= removes the identity coercion. Note that the  
 coercion will never be used directly for simpl_pred, since the canonical  
 instance should always be resolved.

 Bespoke structures that provide fine-grained control over matching the     
 various forms of the \in predicate; note in particular the different forms 
 of hoisting that are used. We had to work around several bugs in the       
 implementation of unification, notably improper expansion of telescope     
 projections and overwriting of a variable assignment by a later            
 unification (probably due to conversion cache cross-talk).

 Because of the explicit eta expansion in the left-hand side, this lemma    
 should only be used in a right-to-left direction. The 8.3 hack allowing    
 partial right-to-left use does not work with the improved expansion        
 heuristics in 8.4.

 Instances that strip the mem cast; the first one has "pred_of_mem" as its  
 projection head value, while the second has "pred_of_simpl". The latter    
 has the side benefit of preempting accidental misdeclarations.             
 Note: pred_of_mem is the registered mem &gt;-&gt; pred_class coercion, while     
 simpl_of_mem; pred_of_simpl is the mem &gt;-&gt; pred &gt;=&gt; Funclass coercion. We  
 must write down the coercions explicitly as the Canonical head constant

 Weakening and monotonicity lemmas for localized predicates.                
 Note that using these lemmas in backward reasoning will force expansion of 
 the predicate definition, as Coq needs to expose the quantifier to apply   
 these lemmas. We define a few specialized variants to avoid this for some  
 of the ssrfun predicates.
